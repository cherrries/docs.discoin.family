# üèó \[WIP] Technical Roadmap

{% hint style="warning" %}
This Technical Roadmap is a work-in-progress. We'll be updating it frequently as work begins and more concrete details become available.
{% endhint %}

We propose to begin with a pragmatic, effective approach where necessary, and to gradually and iteratively replace trustful solutions (multisigs) with trustless tooling (smart contract governance) where it would be logical to implement.

As we work with our technical partners, we will revise this document, adding different tooling details, specifications and projected delivery dates.

### Bounties

After evaluation of each item with partners and advisors, we will assign bounties for work completed on particular elements in our roadmap as indicated. If you are interested in working with us and starting work against a bounty, reach out to cherrries@protonmail.com

{% hint style="success" %}
As bounties become we will publish them on a bounty list on a page on this site. Be sure to follow [@JaelCartel](https://twitter.com/JaelCartel) on Twitter for updates.
{% endhint %}

### Phase 1

#### Multisigs

A number of Discoin committees will be formed to steward the proper distribution schedule of Discoin.  These committees will be bound to act on the multisig in accordance with the Discoin Litepaper. \
\
Be aware that the Discoin committees will hold the funds in trust for distribution. They will be effectively frozen until distribution / inflation events. The funds will not be available for spending for any reason until they are released by inflation into the respective Governance wallets, which will be created and used at the first distribution epoch for that fund.

For example, the funds in the Discoin Community Fund Committee multisig will keep the funds frozen in the committee wallet until the first distribution event, where the funds will be airdropped to the wallet of the governance structure that will control the purse strings for the Community Fund in accordance with whatever community governance protocol is established for that purpose.

Note that during Genesis the Treasury multisig receives an airdrop -- this is a governance wallet, so from the Genesis event there will be funds that need to be governed by the community.
