# ðŸ˜Ž Charles moves to Multisig

[Charles was moved](https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/075dd60b1e6937da1e3cd11689b19c4456c7721454df173a59dee13b57aef5cf) into the [#JaelCartel multisig treasury wallet](https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1x9jr88m3n22a8lyyxnxnygl0r9fvgjf7qthemugl3nl3jsnyxw0hrx54607ggdxdxg377x2jc3ynuqh0nhc3lr8lr9pqjzlt2p) on 04/15/2022.\


{% hint style="info" %}
Charles will remain within the multisig until the Cartel is prepared to fractionalize through using tooling developed in partnership with [ADAO](https://twitter.com/ADAOcommunity).
{% endhint %}

The multisig treasury wallet was created with support from [ADAO](https://twitter.com/ADAOcommunity), who created a tool for creating multisig treasuries called [round-table](https://github.com/ADAOcommunity/round-table). The [Disco Solaris](https://discosolaris.com) community thanks ADAO for their work on behalf of the entire Cardano community to create this valuable tool.

The multisig is configured to require three of five (3/5) signatures to make transactions. The signatories on the multisig were chosen from the #JaelCartel commissioners.

The commissioners on the multisig are:

* PapÃ³ (PapÃ³#2713)
* CryptoMarm (CrytpoMarm#2655)
* Grancho (Grancho#9239)
* Mogul (Mogul#6345)
* Teal Titan (Teal Titan#8575)
