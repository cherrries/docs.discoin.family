#### Snapshot

{% hint style="success" %}
Snapshot Window begins July 1, 2022 and ends at an indeterminate time in the future.
{% endhint %}

The Airdrop Snapshot selects a random moment during the Snapshot Window to include the addresses of wallets containing Disco Solaris PFP NFTs with the total amount held per wallet for the eligibility list.

This means that at any time during the Snapshot Window, the Snapshot will be chosen **at random**. The design of the snapshot is intended to maximize fairness and to incentivize long-term community involvement instead of speculation on the PFP NFTs themselves in relation to this Airdrop.

To be eligible, the following must occur:

* Each Disco Solaris PFP NFT must be in a non-custodial wallet.
  * <mark style="color:red;">**All publicly known custodial marketplace wallets or contracts will not qualify, including, but not limited to:**</mark>
    * <mark style="color:red;">****</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">**jpg.store**</mark>](https://www.jpg.store/)<mark style="color:red;">****</mark>
    * <mark style="color:red;">****</mark>[<mark style="color:red;">**cnft.io**</mark>](https://cnft.io/)<mark style="color:red;">****</mark>
* To claim, you will only need to submit the wallet address with your PFP NFTs during the claim period.

More details about claiming the drop will be released late July 2022.
