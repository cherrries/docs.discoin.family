# ðŸª‚ Airdrop Details

Neo Miami Citizens (Disco Solaris PFP NFT Holders) will soon be eligible to claim the Discoin Airdrop from the new Airdrop Claim & Staking Portal.&#x20;

### Eligibility

#### Snapshot

The Airdrop Snapshot selects a random moment during the Snapshot Window to include for the eligibility list.

This means that at any time during the Snapshot Window, the Snapshot will be chosen **at random**. The design of the snapshot is intended to maximize fairness and to incentivize long-term community involvement instead of speculation on the PFP NFTs themselves in relation to this Airdrop.

Snapshot Window begins July 1, 2022 and ends at an indeterminate time in the future.

To be eligible, the following must occur:

* Each Disco Solaris PFP NFT must be in a non-custodial wallet.
