# ðŸª™ Discoin

### Why Discoin?

Discoin is the community currency of Neo Miami. Discoin ($DISCO) was created by members of the [DISCO SOLARIS](https://discosolaris.com) community to empower Disco Solaris NFT holders (Neo Miami Citizens). With Discoin, Disco Solaris NFT holders will be able to stake their coins, participate in governance through our DAO, and spend their $DISCO in the Neo Miami Entertainment District economy.&#x20;

Discoin is intended to holistically ensure the well-being of each and every Neo Miami Citizen and to empower creators -- builders and artists of all kinds and types. This currency is designed to be the lifeblood or energy that connects us through community. The intention is to create the conditions necessary for true empowerment to emerge for each individual in Neo Miami and for the community as a collective.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Discoin is a community-led project and has no direct affiliation with the DISCO SOLARIS production studio, Dim Blue Dot.

On March 5th, 2022. [Charles, Disco Solaris NFT #0007, was purchased for 125,000ADA](https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/d795c05d6185cee0f6d2cd73fa3ed0dd4cab6aa0d41fbe5d713900b87de8a6ce).

He will be divided up into 5,777,777,777 pieces, creating each Discoin.&#x20;

### The Genesis Airdrop

The Genesis Drop will consist of the distribution of 57,777 $DISCO to each Disco Solaris NFT being held in a non-custodial wallet. If there are Disco Solaris NFTs listed in a custodial wallet when the snapshot is taken, then they will not qualify for the Genesis Drop. The $DISCO intended to go to custodial Disco Solaris NFTs will then be divided evenly amongst non custodial holders.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Disco Solaris NFTs held in custodial wallets, such as in [jpg.store](https://jpg.store), will not receive the Genesis Airdrop.
{% endhint %}

Along with the 57,777 $DISCO being distributed to each non-custodial Disco Solaris NFT, there will be an equal amount put into the Treasury, a strategic reserve.&#x20;

The Treasury will be controlled in accordance with the Constitution, a document which will be collectively and authored ratified by the 5777.

### Staking Rewards for NFT + Discoin Holders

If you own a Disco Solaris NFT and hold it in a non-custodial wallet, you will be eligible to receive Discoin in the Genesis Airdrop. \
\
Disco Solaris NFT holders will be eligible to stake Discoin to receive staking rewards, which is allocated from 50% of annual Discoin inflation.

### Liquidity Providers

Liquidity Providers are essential to creating a real market to buy and sell Discoin.&#x20;

25% of annual Discoin inflation will go toward providing rewards to those that provide Discoin liquidity to the market on various decentralized exchanges (DEXs).&#x20;

The community may also vote on Treasury proposals to allocate Treasury funds for the purposes of providing liquidity.

### The Entertainment District and "Catalyst" Fund for Neo Miami, or Community Fund (CF)

The Entertainment District, or Community Fund, will receive 25% of the total annual distribution of Discoin each year.\
\
Through the Entertainment District, artists and creators will be able to submit proposals for community approval (voting) on the allocation and dispensation of assets. Through this fund, we will empower collaboration between artists within our community and with other projects, communities and artists who wish to engage with us.

By holding one of the 5777 Disco Solaris NFTs, one will become eligible for participation in Entertainment District governance, according to the Constitution. \
\
Whether holding rank #1 or rank #5777, it will carry the same weight in voting. Every additional Disco Solaris NFT a Neo Miami Citizen holds in their wallet in addition to their first Disco Solaris NFT will act as another token to vote.

The Entertainment District will be governed in accordance with the Constitution, a document which will be collectively and authored ratified by the 5777.

### The Treasury - a Strategic Reserve

The Treasury will receive 50% of the initial airdrop, which will allow it to receive 50% of staking rewards in each subsequent emission of Discoin through inflation.&#x20;

The Treasury is a critical component of Discoin's design. The purpose of the Treasury is to ensure the stability and long-term viability of Discoin as the foundation for the ecosystem that it is designed to catalyze.

The full scope and mechanism of governance over the Treasury will be defined in the Constitution.

### Governance

Discoin is an essential component of community empowerment, and its' creation endows the community with significant funds within the Treasury and Entertainment District that can be used to manifest real change and progress.\
\
We wish to initiate the discussion required to define the procedure by which a Constitution can be collectively authored and ratified by the 5777.\
\
We propose that the Governance of the Treasury and Entertainment District be defined in this new community created Constitution.&#x20;
