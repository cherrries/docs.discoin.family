The Charles PFP NFT was fractionalized on 06/13/2022 7:11:52 PM EST. It was carried out using [fracada-il-primo](https://medium.com/dcspark/fracada-il-primo-for-developers-5055dc0834e), an open source library from [dcSpark](https://www.dcspark.io/) that allows for new fractionalization functionality on Cardano. The Plutus contracts were used and deployed without modification.

### Why Discoin?

Discoin is the community currency of Neo Miami. Discoin ($DISCO) was created by members of the [DISCO SOLARIS](https://discosolaris.com) community to empower Disco Solaris NFT holders (Neo Miami Citizens). With Discoin, Disco Solaris NFT holders will be able to stake their coins, participate in governance, and spend their $DISCO in the Neo Miami community economy.

Discoin is intended to holistically ensure the well-being of each and every Neo Miami Citizen and to empower creators -- builders and artists of all kinds and types. This currency is designed to be the lifeblood or energy that connects us through community. The intention is to create the conditions necessary for true empowerment to emerge for each individual in Neo Miami and for the community as a collective.

{% hint style="info" %}
Discoin is a community-led project and has no direct affiliation with the DISCO SOLARIS production studio, Dim Blue Dot.

### The Airdrop

The Airdrop will consist of the distribution of 57,777 $DISCO to each Disco Solaris NFT being held in a non-custodial wallet.

The $DISCO intended to go to custodial Disco Solaris NFTs will then be divided evenly amongst non custodial holders.
