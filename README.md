### Why Discoin?

Discoin is the community currency of Neo Miami. Discoin ($DISCO) was created by members of the [DISCO SOLARIS](https://discosolaris.com) community to empower Disco Solaris NFT holders (Neo Miami Citizens). With Discoin, Disco Solaris NFT holders will be able to stake their coins, participate in governance, and spend their $DISCO in the Neo Miami community economy.

Discoin is intended to holistically ensure the well-being of each and every Neo Miami Citizen and to empower creators -- builders and artists of all kinds and types. This currency is designed to be the lifeblood or energy that connects us through community. The intention is to create the conditions necessary for true empowerment to emerge for each individual in Neo Miami and for the community as a collective.

{% hint style="info" %}
Discoin is a community-led project and has no direct affiliation with the DISCO SOLARIS production studio, Dim Blue Dot.

On March 5th, 2022. [Charles, Disco Solaris NFT #0007, was purchased for 125,000ADA](https://cardanoscan.io/transaction/d795c05d6185cee0f6d2cd73fa3ed0dd4cab6aa0d41fbe5d713900b87de8a6ce).

He will be divided up into 5,777,777,777 pieces, creating each Discoin.

Each of the 5777 Neo Miami Citizens will receive 57777 Discoin in the genesis airdrop.

By both holding a Disco Solaris NFT and Discoin, you can:

* Earn staking rewards
* Vote on and sumbit Treasury proposals
  * 1 Disco Solaris NFT = 1 vote
  * must have minimum amount of Discoin per Disco Solaris NFT in same wallet
* Vote on and submit Community Fund proposals
  * 1 Disco Solaris NFT = 1 vote
  * must have minimum amount of Discoin per Disco Solaris NFT in same wallet

### The Airdrop

The Airdrop will consist of the distribution of 57,777 $DISCO to each Disco Solaris NFT being held in a non-custodial wallet. If there are Disco Solaris NFTs listed in a custodial wallet when the snapshot is taken, then they will not qualify for the Airdrop. The $DISCO intended to go to custodial Disco Solaris NFTs will then be divided evenly amongst non custodial holders.

Disco Solaris NFTs held in custodial wallets, such as in [jpg.store](https://jpg.store), will not receive the Genesis Airdrop.
